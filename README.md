## Relevance

The library management web application is designed to streamline the organization and handling of book collections in diverse settings. It is well-suited for application in public libraries, academic environments, and private collections. This web application provides a streamlined, accessible approach to resource management, making it easier to perform administrative duties. Its adaptability makes it a valuable tool for enhancing the management and user engagement of libraries of all types and sizes.


## Concept

The library management web application is a versatile system designed to manage various aspects of a library.  It equips users with robust functionalities, including the creation, modification, and removal of book records, user profiles, categories, and borrowing orders. Patrons of the library can conveniently search for books, reserve books, manage their borrowing history, and process returns directly through the platform.

Library administrators benefit immensely from the system's capability to manage the book inventory with precision. New books can be cataloged, existing entries can be updated with current information, and obsolete records can be purged as needed. The application allows for the integration of author information and categorization, facilitating an organized and searchable library database.

A critical component of the application is the order management system. Users can place orders for book loans, specify the duration of borrowings, and track their order history. The feature of returning books is streamlined to update the system in real-time, ensuring that the inventory is always current.

Security is paramount, thus the application incorporates user authentication and role-based authorization mechanisms. These features guarantee that only authorized users can access specific functionalities, safeguarding the system's integrity and the privacy of user data.

Multi-language support is provided for English and Ukrainian.
